Currently implemented and in the process of testing:

1. Loading all application resources into IndexedDB and then auto-updating them. During subsequent connections, only the basic framework framework is loaded from the network.
2.For applications that do not require the Internet for their operation, it is possible to install Service Worker. In this case, after the first download of the application and resources, the application has the opportunity to start and work in the complete absence of the Internet.
3. Added the manifest file for PWA.

The code is mostly documented. A more detailed guide to the framework will be written later.
